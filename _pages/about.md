I am a post-doctoral researcher at the [Heersink School of Medicine, The University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB)](https://www.uab.edu/medicine/home/). At UAB, I am advised by Professor Surya P. Bhatt, who is a leading pulmonologist with research interests in understanding COPD through lung imaging.

Before joining UAB, I was a Roy J. Carver Ph.D. Scholar in the [Roy J. Carver Department of Biomedical Engineering at The University of Iowa](https://engineering.uiowa.edu/bme). I was fortunate to be advised by Professor Joseph M. Reinhardt, who is a pioneer in image registration-based lung biomechanics. I also had the privilege of working with amazing co-advisors: Professor Eric A. Hoffman, a world-leading expert in pulmonary physiology and lung imaging, and Professor Gary E. Christensen, a leading figure in medical image registration.

My research focuses primarily on medical image analysis, generative deep learning, and image registration. My recent works include the development of generative models for understanding local tissue properties of the lung, especially for characterizing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
