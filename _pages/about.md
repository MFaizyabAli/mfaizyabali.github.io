I am an Instructor at the [Heersink School of Medicine, The University of Alabama at Birmingham](https://www.uab.edu/medicine/home/). Before joining UAB, I was a Carver Ph.D. Scholar in the [Roy J. Carver Department of Biomedical Engineering at The University of Iowa](https://engineering.uiowa.edu/bme). My research focuses primarily on medical image analysis, generative deep learning, and image registration. My recent works include the development of generative models for understanding local tissue properties of the lung, especially for characterizing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
