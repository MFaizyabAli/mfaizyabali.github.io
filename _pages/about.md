I am a post-doctoral researcher at the [Heersink School of Medicine, The University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB)](https://www.uab.edu/medicine/home/), where I am advised by [Professor Surya P. Bhatt](https://scholars.uab.edu/631-surya-bhatt). Before joining UAB, I was a Carver Ph.D. Scholar in the [Roy J. Carver Department of Biomedical Engineering at The University of Iowa (UIOWA)](https://engineering.uiowa.edu/bme). I was fortunate to be advised by [Professor Joseph M. Reinhardt](https://engineering.uiowa.edu/directory/joseph-m-reinhardt) and amazing co-advisors [Professor Eric A. Hoffman](https://radiology.medicine.uiowa.edu/people/faculty/eric-hoffman), [Professor Gary E. Christensen](https://engineering.uiowa.edu/directory/gec), and [Professor Sarah E. Gerard](https://engineering.uiowa.edu/directory/sarah-e-gerard). 

My research interests lie at the intersection of deep generative modeling, deformable image registration (DIR), and multimodal lung imaging. During my Ph.D., I worked towards developing deep image generative models for understanding local tissue properties of the lung, especially for characterizing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). I developed a novel generative adversarial learning framework, [LungViT](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10439260), for cross-volume chest CT imaging. In a first, this method formed the basis for estimating regional measures of lung function from a single chest CT scan. After defending my Ph.D. dissertation.

My current research involves development of multimodal medical image-to-image translation and deep learning-based DIR methods. Clinically, my work is centered on understanding early indicators of severe COPD exacerbations and progression. To this end, I am actively involved with the development and validation of chest CT biomarkers that capture lung tissue texture and airway tree morphology, with the goal of improving early detection and monitoring progression.
