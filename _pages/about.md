I am a post-doctoral researcher at the [Heersink School of Medicine, The University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB)](https://www.uab.edu/medicine/home/). At UAB, I am advised by [Professor Surya P. Bhatt](https://scholars.uab.edu/631-surya-bhatt), who is a leading pulmonologist with research interests in understanding COPD through lung imaging.

Before joining UAB, I was a Carver Ph.D. Scholar in the [Roy J. Carver Department of Biomedical Engineering at The University of Iowa (UIOWA)](https://engineering.uiowa.edu/bme). I was fortunate to be advised by [Professor Joseph M. Reinhardt](https://engineering.uiowa.edu/directory/joseph-m-reinhardt), who is a pioneer in image registration-based lung biomechanics. I also had the privilege of working with amazing co-advisors: [Professor Eric A. Hoffman](https://radiology.medicine.uiowa.edu/people/faculty/eric-hoffman), a world-leading expert in pulmonary physiology and lung imaging, and [Professor Gary E. Christensen](https://engineering.uiowa.edu/directory/gec), a leading figure in medical image registration. During my Ph.D., I worked towards developing deep image generative models for understanding local tissue properties of the lung, especially for characterizing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). I developed a novel generative adversarial learning framework, [LungViT](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10439260), for cross-volume chest CT imaging. In a first for the field, this method formed the basis for estimating regional measures of lung function from a single chest CT scan. After defending my Ph.D. dissertation, I briefly worked at the [Pulmonary Imaging and Computer Vision Lab](https://gerard.lab.uiowa.edu) at UIOWA, where I was mentored by [Professor Sarah E. Gerard](https://engineering.uiowa.edu/directory/sarah-e-gerard). Dr. Gerard is a leading expert in highly-imbalanced medical image segmentation methods who developed a state-of-the-art pulmonary fissure segmentation method. During this brief post-doctoral research, I developed semi-supervised medical image segmentation and deformable image-to-image translation methods.

Prior to my Ph.D., I was a research assistant at the [Algorithms in Theory and Practice (ATP) Lab](https://web.lums.edu.pk/~hmd/index.html) at Lahore University of Management Sciences. I also worked as a research team lead for one year at the [Biomedical Informatics and Engineering Research Lab (BIRL)](https://birl.lums.edu.pk).
