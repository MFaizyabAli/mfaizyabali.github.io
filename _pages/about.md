I am an Instructor at the [Heersink School of Medicine, The University of Alabama at Birmingham](https://www.uab.edu/medicine/home/). Before joining UAB, I was a Carver Ph.D. Scholar in the [Roy J. Carver Department of Biomedical Engineering at The University of Iowa](https://engineering.uiowa.edu/bme). My research focuses primarily on medical image analysis, generative deep learning, and image registration. My recent works include the development of generative models for understanding local tissue properties of the lung, especially for characterizing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.
